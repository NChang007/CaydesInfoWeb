          "—so there you have it, Ace, that's why I did what I did. I had no choice, really. It was that or the great beyond. Just know your dad did what he had to do if I ever wanted to see you and your mother again."

          — Cayde's journal
          <br/>
          Cayde used to be a human soldier with a large debt over his head, when he was approached by Clovis Bray to have his debt removed. The job offer itself isn't explicitly stated, but what Cayde remembers next is coming to Europa where he was converted into an Exo. Cayde's Letter Fragments in Destiny 2 reveal that Cayde had a wife and a son whom he nicknamed "Ace", he threw his life away from gambling, and that his only means of escape was to sell himself to Clovis Bray's Exo program. Unable to contact his family, he kept a journal which he addressed to Ace.

          "Things are even weirder now, Ace. This is my fourth assignment, and I am kind of losing touch with what came before this whole Exo thing and what's a leftover fragment from another tour."

          — Cayde's journal
          <br/>
          Upon becoming an Exo, Cayde spent some amount of time in the Eventide colony on Europa, at one point coming across Micah Abram as the boy tried to sneak into Bray Exoscience; Cayde had flashbacks of the encounter even after his five subsequent resets. He continued to write in his journal as a means of preserving his memories. As many Exos, he resented the need for resets and in his diary logs promised Ace never to let Clovis Bray track him down when he finally finds his family.
          <br/>
          At some point he was assigned as a security officer to the Ishtar Collective, where his job was to look after Dr. Maya Sundaresh. Though he wished to get to know her better, she barely noticed him.
          <br/>
          Cayde witnessed the Collapse, remembering being restrained by a shadowy creature on a destroyed world. It is unclear whether that was the moment of his death or not.

      <h3><strong>Early Career as a Guardian</strong></h3>

      "Cayde is a cunning hunter, with years of experience in staying alive in the wilds. But, um, fighting a war isn't his strong suit. I'm not sure the 'shoot them all to death' strategy is going to be enough."
      <br/>
      — Ghost
      <br/>
      Cayde was found with a journal containing Ace's name on his person after being revived by his Ghost, Sundance. He reportedly freaked out right after the resurrection, smacking the Ghost and ran off a cliff. Despite not remembering a thing about Ace other than what the journal had told him, Cayde continued to address subsequent entries to the boy. The memory of him and his mother, whom Cayde dubbed "his Queen", was what helped Cayde through the toughest times and "made him a better man". Later, in a series of audio logs addressed either to Ace or the possible future "Cayde-7", he would admit he was not sure if the memories were even real or his own delusion he had constructed to "make himself whole".
      <br/>
      He apparently tried to get into Mara Sov's good graces and learn some answers from her, though to what questions remains unclear; the Queen ordered him to search for the Vault of Glass, most likely before the Guardians even learned what it was.
      <br/>
      While searching for a Hive Shrine on the Moon, Cayde found a Hive structure and entered it. Inside, he encountered a huge horde of Hive consisting of Thralls, Knights, and Wizards and promptly retreated. The Hive pursued him to the surface, and Cayde cut down many Thrall before running out of ammo for his Machine Gun. Taking cover behind a crashed Phaeton, Cayde spotted a Fallen Baroness of the House of Exile fighting the Hive as well. The Hive pushed back both Cayde and the Baroness onto a hill with an old interferometry array on top of it. Fighting together, the two killed most of the Hive and Cayde eventually climbed the array to get an angle on the Wizards and saw the Baroness kill a Knight but lose her blades in the process. From his perch, Cayde exhausted the rest of his ammo, but only one Wizard and a line of Thral remained. After climbing back down, Cayde saw the Baroness was badly wounded and he wondered how many people she had murdered. The Baroness then tossed her last Shock Pistol to Cayde, but when he went to grab it she attempted to stab him. However, she was slow and Cayde easily dodged her, and he proceeded to break her arms and slit her throat. Cayde wondered if the Baroness had truly wanted to kill him or if she did that to make his choice about ending her easier. Cayde proceeded to use the Shock Pistol to kill the remaining Hive.
      <br/>
      Cayde attended the funeral of the Warlock Albios on the moon of Io. Although he liked Albios, Cayde quickly grew bored during the long service and made a bet with Banshee-44 that he could pull off several high-risk jumps on the nearby mesas. He won the bet, although he broke both his legs completing the jumps. Cayde hid his winnings in one of his hidden caches in the mesas.
      <br/>
      Cayde-6 was once a daring and adventurous Guardian, so of course, he couldn't say no to a challenge - not even the notorious Vanguard Dare. He won the bet, to his immense regret. It is implied the bet was on who could kill the Fallen mercenary Taniks, the Scarred, but Cayde took over as the Hunter Vanguard when his predecessor and close friend, Andal Brask, was murdered by the mercenary. Though Cayde serves dutifully, he yearns to return to the field, in particular having his eyes set on the mythical Vault of Glass.
